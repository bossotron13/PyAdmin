So, it works. There is a webgui that is currently hard coded (sorry) and it working, going to look into multiprocess for the webserver. might help, to use it (I dont recommend) download everything and remove server file, create your own server file and put your jar in there (same name its hard coded), change the ip in app.py and your set.

You can only Start, Stop, and Restart the server currently
